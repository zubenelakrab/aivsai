# AI vs AI: A Conversational AI Experiment

This code is an experimental project exploring the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to create a conversational AI system. It is a work in progress and may not always function perfectly.

## Features:

* Two LLMs (Renato and Elsa) with different areas of expertise engage in a conversation about a specified topic.
* The conversation is dynamic, with each LLM responding to the other's prompts and questions.
* The temperature parameter is randomized for each message, introducing variability in the responses and making the conversation more unpredictable.
* The conversation history is tracked, allowing the LLMs to refer to previous messages and build upon the context.

## How to Use:

1. Install the required libraries: ollama, time, random, and termcolor.
2. Run the script: `python aivsai.py`.
3. The conversation will start automatically.

## Limitations:

* The LLMs may sometimes generate irrelevant or nonsensical responses.
* The conversation may not always be coherent or follow a logical flow.
* The LLMs may not always provide accurate or complete information.

## Future Development:

* Improve the coherence and flow of the conversation.
* Enhance the LLMs' ability to provide accurate and relevant information.
* Add features such as sentiment analysis and topic tracking.

This project is open to contributions. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request.

Enjoy the conversation!
